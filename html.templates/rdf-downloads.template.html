      <h1>Cellosaurus RDF files download</h1>
    <div style="padding-left: 80px; padding-right:60px; ">
      The RDF data is available as a compressed tar file. It contains several files in Turtle format (ttl) including both ontology, metadata, query examples and data. <br>
      The content reflects what is made available at our sparql endpoint.
      <ul>
        <li><a download href="/static/downloads/cellosaurus_ttl.tar.gz">cellosaurus_ttl.tar.gz</a></li>
      </ul> 
      In addition we provide with additional Turtle files which can be loaded on top of those in
      <i>cellosaurus_ttl.tar.gz</i> in order to speed up the execution of some SPARQL queries especially 
      for triple stores with low memory resources (RAM).<br>      
      The additional files contain the materialization of some inferable triples. 
      In RDF/SPARQL materialization refers to the process of explicitly generating and storing all possible 
      inferred triples based on the existing data and defined rules or ontologies. This process involves:
      <ul>
        <li>Applying inference rules to the existing RDF data</li>
        <li>Creating new triples that logically follow from the original data</li>
        <li>Storing these newly inferred triples alongside the original data</li>
      </ul>
      Materialization can help in several ways:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Query Performance</b> : It improves query execution speed by pre-computing inferred relationships, 
          eliminating the need for real-time inference during query processing</li>
        <li><b>Simplified Querying</b> : Users can write simpler queries without needing to account for complex 
          inference rules, as all possible relationships are already explicit in the data</li>
        <li><b>Consistency</b> : It ensures that all applications accessing the data see the same inferred 
          information, maintaining consistency across different use cases</li>
        <li><b>Scalability</b> : For large datasets, materialization can be more efficient than computing 
          inferences on-the-fly, especially when the same inferences are needed repeatedly</li>
      </ul>
      
      In our case, the usage of inferred triples makes the usage of "*", "?", "+" and "{n,m} symbols in SPARQL 
      query property path expressions unnecessary and may notably improve performance on queries involving a 
      concept and all the concepts that are more specific than it according to some concept scheme. For example:
      <pre>
select * where {
  ?something ?related_somehow_to ?any_concept .
  ... 
  ?any_concept cello:more_specific_than* ?concept .
  ?concept skos:inScheme db:NCBI_TaxID ; skos:notation "50557"^^xsd:string .  # Insecta
}</pre>
      would not require "*" (a path of zero or more occurrences of cello:more_specific_than) and would run faster after
      loading the files proposed below. The files can be found here:
      <ul>
        <li><a download href="/static/downloads/materialized_transitive_more_specific_than.ttl">materialized_transitive_more_specific_than.ttl</a></li>
        <li><a download href="/static/downloads/materialized_transitive_subproperties.ttl">materialized_transitive_subproperties.ttl</a></li>
        <li><a download href="/static/downloads/materialized_transitive_subclasses.ttl">materialized_transitive_subclasses.ttl</a></li>
      </ul>
